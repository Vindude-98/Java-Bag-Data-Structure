# Java-Bag-Data-Structure

Java Bag Data Structure
In this assignment, you will implement a Java bag data structure, also known as a multiset. A bag is a collection of elements that allows duplicates and does not enforce any particular order. Your task is to design and implement a bag class in Java that supports basic operations such as adding elements, removing elements, checking if an element exists, and counting the occurrences of an element.

Design a Java class called `Bag` that implements the bag data structure.
The `Bag` class should have the following methods:
`void add(T item)`: This method should add an item of type T to the bag.
`void remove(T item)`: This method should remove one occurrence of the item from the bag, if it exists.
 `boolean contains(T item)`: This method should return true if the item exists in the bag; otherwise, it should return false.   
Write a Java program that demonstrates the usage of the `Bag` class. Your program should perform the following operations:
Create an instance of the `Bag` class.
Add several elements to the bag, including duplicates.
Print the bag contents.
Test the `contains` method for a few elements.
Test the `count` method for a few elements.
Remove an element from the bag.
Print the bag contents again
Test the `contains` method for the removed element.
Test the `count` method for the removed element.
Comment your code appropriately to explain the functionality of each method
